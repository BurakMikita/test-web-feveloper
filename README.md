1. You can win by catching all the Pokemon
2. Also, time affects the time of your victory
3. Save the game state to localStorage and after reboot the state remains
4. every time we click the game we clear the state
5. Create a restart button
6. If the character can't catch the Pokémon within 3 seconds, it disappears.


What I would have liked to do but didn’t manage to:

1. Split the code into smaller parts for better readability and easier modifications.
2. Added data loading from localhost after a restart or from a JSON file.
3. Moved heavy logic functions to separate files.
4. Removed the use of any in TypeScript everywhere.
5. Eliminated duplication.
6. Added Jest tests.
7. Saved the time when a player resumes the game in a JSON file and in local storage.
8. I would like to add at the beginning of the page the number of Pokémon you want to add.
9. I also added styles for the character and the Pokémon.
10. I would also split all the styles and create separate folders.
